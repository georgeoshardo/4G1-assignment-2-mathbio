# DNA bead spring model
This code models DNA extension as a bead-spring system in a Brownian field undergoing force-extension from each end.

For a given length of DNA, it outputs the (x, y, z) coordinates of each bead at each time-point while it undergoes extension due to a constant force in the x-direction.
